# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The purpose of this repository is to aid in understanding why Requirement analysis is necessary in any software development project.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where we gather, analyze, and define the requirements of the software product to be developed.
It is a crucial step in software development, as it allows us to define the scope of the project backed by documented and factual data.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- It helps to define the scope of the project.
- Ensures the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
- Helps to clarify and understand what the stakeholders expect from the software.
- Gives us an accurate estimation of the project cost, resources, and time.
- Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
  
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering - methods we can use to gather requirements from the relevant stakeholders, this can be done via: interviews, workshops, surveys. We can also gather information from existing documentation and systems to understand current requirements.
2. Requiring Elicitation - this is refining the requirements that were collected in the first step. This process may entail the following:
   - Conducting brainstorming sessions.
   - Holding focus groups with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
   - Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system.
3. Requirement Documentation - this entails giving a detailed documentation of functional and non-functional requirements of the project. One can also create use case stories and diagrams to show the varied interactions between different users and the system.
4. Requirement Analysis and Modelling - creating a model to visualize and analyze requirements, e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams. There is also an assessment on the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
5. Requirement Validation - Review the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness. Definition of acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
