# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The purpose of this repository is to aid in understanding why Requirement analysis is necessary in any software development project.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where we gather, analyze, and define the requirements of the software product to be developed.
It is a crucial step in software development, as it allows us to define the scope of the project backed by documented and factual data.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- It helps to define the scope of the project.
- Ensures the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
- Helps to clarify and understand what the stakeholders expect from the software.
- Gives us an accurate estimation of the project cost, resources, and time.
- Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
